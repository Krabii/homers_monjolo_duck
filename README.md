# Homer's Monjolo Duck
## A random mouse movement application to fake presence at work in a remote setting


Monjolo: A water scoop, simple hydropower machine that uses power from the flow of water to drive a machine intermittently.


### Installation

#### Linux
* Copy homers_monjolo.sh in `/usr/local/bin` path
* make executable with `chmod +x /usr/local/bin/homers_monjolo.sh`

Note: You might have to `sudo` all the above

#### Mac
You shouldn't be faking work presence, you actually need to work to make money for your next Macbook which I heard will be very expensive.

* Follow Linux instalation

### Usage
After installing, run `homers_monjolo.sh` from any open terminal. Enjoy slacking at work...
